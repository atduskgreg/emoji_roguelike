# emoji_roguelike

## Goals

* Let the alchemical logic of emoji lead the way
* Fix the roguelike problem of the early game becoming repetitive over many runs
  * Make early decisions that give you very different experiences in the early game
* Bright and cheery but also with weird monsters and threats
* Question of combat
  * Keep the iconic hack and slash of classic roguelikes
  * and/or significantly more investment in non-combat mechanics
* Character creation
  * Vincent Baker-style back story + mechanics accumulation
